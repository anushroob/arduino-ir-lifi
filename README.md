# arduino-ir-lifi
This project demonstrates a one-way Li-Fi communication system using Infrared (IR) light between two Arduino boards. It allows the user to transmit a string message via IR LED, which is then received, decoded, and displayed on an I2C LCD module. A buzzer alerts the receiver upon successful message completion.
